# Demo Application

This is a demo application I developed to understand how gradle, protobuf, swagger and postgresql work 

## Profiles

The application can make use of three profiles. One can decide to enable/disable the automatic generation of migration scripts by adding removing the `autoGenerateDDL`. 
The `no-security` profile can be activated in order to bypass http basic authentication when calling the rest endpoints. The `local` profile can be used to override some of the default configurations.

## Flyway Migrations

The intent is to be able to generate sql migration automatically starting from the Java entities. For this to work the `autoGenerateDDL` must be active.

## Swagger UI

In order to reach the swagger docs, one can jump to the following URL: http://localhost:8071/swagger-ui

## TODO
- [ ] Export Rest endpoints to C#
